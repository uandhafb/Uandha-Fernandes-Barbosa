# CART398-LC-OPaD
## One Patch a Day

For CART398 – Live Coding, you are expected to commit and push one patch per day throughout the term. These patches should respond to concepts, techniques, and aesthetic questions addressed in class.

Depending on the point in the term, patches may focus on sound and music generation, visuals, text, or web-based modulation.

You must submit five patches per week, over ten weeks, for a total of 50 patches.

Weekly submissions are due Mondays at 23:59, the day before class.

Clone this repository as a template. The five files included are examples of my first week’s submission.


Use the following file extensions:

- For Strudel files: `.strudel`
- For Hydra files: `.hydra`
- For JavaScript files: `.js`

Indicate your favorite patch of the week by including FAV in the filename. For example: `01-FAV.strudel`. Remember to never use spaces in filenames.

Enjoy!
